**Questions**

1. **What was the overall trend in total sales over the months?**
   - *Answer:* The overall trend in total sales over the months showed that sales experienced fluctuations. Sales were relatively low in the earlier months, followed by a gradual increase. The peak sales occurred around December.

2. **What are the top-selling products based on the quantity ordered?**
   - *Answer:* The top-selling products, based on the quantity ordered, include products such as 'AAA Batteries,' 'AA Batteries,' 'USB-C Charging Cables,' 'Lightning Charging Cables,' and 'Wired Headphones.' These products had the highest demand throughout the sales dataset.

3. **How does the time of the day (hour) affect total sales?**
   - *Answer:* Total sales exhibit variations throughout the day, with distinct peaks during specific hours. Sales typically start to rise in the morning, peak during the day, and then experience a gradual decline in the evening. The highest sales usually occur during the day.

4. **What is the average profit margin for the products sold?**
   - *Answer:* The average profit margin for the products sold is approximately -inf. This value suggests that there might be issues with the dataset or calculations, as an average profit margin cannot be negative infinity. It is essential to examine and correct the data or calculations for a meaningful profit margin.

5. **Are there any significant correlations among the numerical variables in the dataset?**
   - *Answer:* The correlation heatmap analysis reveals several insights. Notably, there are no strong correlations among the numerical variables. For instance, 'Quantity Ordered' and 'Sales' do not exhibit a significant positive correlation. This means that the quantity ordered does not necessarily lead to higher sales. Similarly, 'Month' and 'Sales' do not have a strong positive correlation, indicating that sales do not strictly follow monthly patterns.

6. **How do sales vary among different cities?**
   - *Answer:* The 'Sales vs. City' analysis shows that there are variations in sales among different cities. The city with the highest total sales is identified, making it a prime location for product sales. Understanding these variations can help businesses allocate resources and develop tailored strategies for each city.

7. **What are the top products in terms of quantity ordered and their average prices?**
   - *Answer:* The top products based on quantity ordered are listed along with their respective average prices. This analysis provides insights into products that are not only popular but also potentially profitable due to their average prices.

8. **What is the correlation between the quantity ordered and the price of products?**
   - *Answer:* The correlation heatmap analysis indicates that there is no strong correlation between the quantity ordered and the price of products. In other words, the price of a product does not significantly affect the quantity ordered.

9. **How does sales distribution vary by month and city?**
   - *Answer:* The 'Total Sales Distribution by Month' and 'Total Sales Distribution by City' analyses reveal the distribution of sales over months and among different cities, respectively. These visualizations provide an overview of when and where sales are at their highest and can be valuable for planning marketing and inventory strategies.

10. **What recommendations can be made based on the data analysis for optimizing sales strategies?**
    - *Answer:* Based on the data analysis, businesses can consider the following recommendations:

   - Focus marketing efforts on the peak sales months, especially during December.
   - Stock and promote the top-selling products with a strong focus on cities that contribute the most to sales.
   - Consider time-sensitive promotions or incentives during peak sales hours.
   - Reevaluate pricing strategies, especially for products with low quantity ordered, to potentially increase sales.
   - Investigate and resolve issues that may be causing negative average profit margins, as this indicates a problem with profitability calculations.
